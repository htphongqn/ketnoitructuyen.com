<div class="content_article fl">
<p>For a limited time, we are offering free registered post on all Australian orders over $150. Note that bulky goods still incur an additional postage fee (mainly just the display necks) - this fee is displayed on the detailed product page and in the checkout process. To get free postage, once you've selected over $150 worth of products, make sure you click the "free postage" option on the postage page when checking out. Orders sent this way are fully insured and compensation up to the value of your order is available if it goes missing.</p>
<p><strong>Polaris Global Lighting</strong></p>
<p>Polaris has now been running for over 25 years - we started out specialising in glass - leadlighting, glass blowing, carved glass art - and our shops reflect our progression in this medium. Whilst our emphasis is now on beading (predominantly glass beads), our shops feature many of our other beautiful creations.</p>
